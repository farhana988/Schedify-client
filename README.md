# Schedify (Task Management Application)

This is a Task Management Application built with a clean and minimalistic UI where users can manage their tasks. Tasks are categorized into three sections: To-Do, In Progress, and Done. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks with a drag-and-drop interface. The application is fully responsive and stores tasks in a MongoDB database for persistent data. Real-time updates are handled via Firebase Authentication for user sign-ins and instant synchronization of tasks.
